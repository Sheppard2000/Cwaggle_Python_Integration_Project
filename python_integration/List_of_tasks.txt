The goeal is to recreate stricklands experiment using openAI gym in cwaggle.

the environment, state and, reward will be based on stricklands experiment

this means that the observable state for an agent in the environment will consist of
seven sensors resulting in five different readings.

the action space for each agent will also be the same. Each agent will move forward
at a constant rate. The only action an agent can take is to rotate. So each agent
will have an action space of 5, move forward, turn left a little, turn left a lot,
turn right a little, and turn right a lot.

we will use the same reward function as proposed in stricklands paper.
