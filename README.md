# Comp4780_Cwaggle_Python_Integration_Project
A Project wherein the goal is to allow for the control of cwaggle worlds/agents in python, 
specifically using Open AI Gym, to allow for the use of python based RL packages for further 
RL experiments in the cwaggle environment.


the Testing folder was used for learning pybind11 and the different ways it can be used to 
make python modules out of C++ code

Most of the work is currently being done in the cwaggle_with_pybind directory, 
pybind11 bindings are being written in bridge.cpp under cwaggle_with_pybind/cwaggle/src/cwaggle_bridge.
The testing code in python is being done in test.py under cwaggle_with_pybind/cwaggle/bin.
Some older files used during the learning/testing process were kept and contain outdated tests, code, commands, and tasks.
the files were kept so that I could more easily look back and remeber what I had already done/tried. 
Not all files were kept however, so if there are any holes, that is why.

If there are any questions or comments, I can be contacted at tjsheppard@mun.ca,
and my Discord handel is TSheppard#2195.
